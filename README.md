## 📌 Technologies Used

- React.js  
- Bootstrap  
- Material UI (MUI)  
- HTML5, CSS3  
- JavaScript (ES6)

## **Experiment 1: Designing UI Using Bootstrap Components**

### **Aim**
To design a responsive user interface using a component library (Bootstrap) in a Single Page Application.

### **Software Requirements**
- Node.js  
- React  
- Bootstrap  
- Web Browser  

### **Theory**
Bootstrap is a popular CSS-based component library that provides pre-built UI components such as buttons, cards, forms, and navigation bars. It helps developers build responsive and consistent user interfaces quickly.

### **Procedure**
1. Create a React application.
2. Install Bootstrap using npm.
3. Import Bootstrap CSS into the project.
4. Design UI using Bootstrap components.
5. Run and observe the application.

### **Aim**
To create a card-based UI layout using Bootstrap components.

### **Procedure**
1. Import Bootstrap CSS.
2. Use Bootstrap card and grid system.
3. Display multiple cards dynamically.

### **Concepts Used**
- Bootstrap Cards  
- Grid System  
- Responsive Layout

## **Experiment 3: UI Design Using Material UI Components**

### **Aim**
To design a user interface using Material UI components in React.

### **Software Requirements**
- React  
- Material UI (@mui/material)

### **Theory**
Material UI is a React-based component library that follows Google’s Material Design principles. It provides ready-to-use components such as buttons, cards, layouts, and typography.

### **Procedure**
1. Install Material UI packages.
2. Import required components.
3. Design UI using Material UI elements.
